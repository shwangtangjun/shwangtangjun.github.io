16:T4c8,Differential equations have demonstrated intrinsic connections to network structures, linking discrete network layers through continuous equations. Most existing approaches focus on the interaction between ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and feature transformations, primarily working on input signals. In this paper, we study the partial differential equation (PDE) model of neural networks, viewing the neural network as a functional operating on a base model provided by the last layer of the classifier. Inspired by scale-space theory, we theoretically prove that this mapping can be formulated by a convection-diffusion equation, under interpretable and intuitive assumptions from both neural network and PDE perspectives. This theoretically certified framework covers various existing network structures and training techniques, offering a mathematical foundation and new insights into neural networks. Moreover, based on the convection-diffusion equation model, we design a new network structure that incorporates a diffusion mechanism into the network architecture from a PDE perspective. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.17:T4b3,Diffusion, a fundamental internal mechanism emerging in many physical processes, describes the interaction among different objects. In many learning tasks with limited training samples, the diffusion connects the labeled and unlabeled data points and is a critical component for achieving high classification accuracy. Many existing deep learning approaches directly impose the fusion loss when training neural networks. In this work, inspired by the convection-diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet), internally introduces diffusion into the architectures of neural networks. Under the structured data assumption, it is proved that the proposed diffusion block can increase the distance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points and reduces the distance among local intra-class points. Moreover, this property can be easily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable hyperplanes. Extensive experiments of synthetic binary classification, semi-supervised graph node classification and few-shot image classification in various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12","children":[["$","$L15",null,{"config":{"type":"publication","title":"Publications","source":"publications.bib"},"publications":[{"id":"wang2025interface","title":"Interface Laplace Learning: Learnable Interface Term Helps Semi-Supervised Learning","authors":[{"name":"Tangjun Wang","isHighlighted":true,"isCorresponding":false,"isCoAuthor":false},{"name":"Chenglong Bao","isHighlighted":false,"isCorresponding":false,"isCoAuthor":false},{"name":"Zuoqiang Shi","isHighlighted":false,"isCorresponding":false,"isCoAuthor":false}],"year":2025,"month":"12","type":"journal","journal":"CSIAM Transactions on Applied Mathematics (to appear)","conference":"","doi":"10.4208/csiam-am.SO-2024-0064","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05419","code":"https://github.com/shwangtangjun/Inter-Laplace","abstract":"We introduce a novel framework, called Interface Laplace Learning, for graph-based semi-supervised learning.

In the proposed approach, we add an interface term to the Laplace learning model at the interface positions. We provide a practical algorithm to approximate the interface positions using k-hop neighborhood indices, and to learn the interface term from labeled data without artificial design.
